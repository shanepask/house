**Notes:**
- Woodwork = preparation (sanding, filling, priming) + painting (no varnishing or staining) **unless specified as "New woodwork"**, which means supplying and installing new skirting, architraves, doors, etc.
- Hallway and landing now require fully new woodwork elements and new doors throughout.
- Many areas involve new skirting, architraves, coving, carpets, and painting as recurring themes.
- Electrical work appears in several rooms — consider grouping for an electrician quote.
- Plumbing/damp-related items (attic drainage, basement re-tanking) may need specialist trades.
